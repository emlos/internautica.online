Hey its me [milo]!
im a 2X year old depressee and college dropout :')
im mostly a collector of everything that i like and base my personality on, in my search for dumb happiness and stupid meaning, so feel free to check out my art page, where i put the works that make me feel *something*

i *was* gonna port my shrines to this version of my site, but frankly i am starting to like the low-css/js approach here
if you want something to get excited about, though, here you go:
 - [song translation page]({{'/translation/' | url}})
 - dark mode! (check out the toggle above!)
 - eleventy base project maybe?
 - zines page? ive made two in my whole life but i had ideas for two more
 - fandomy art page! i deleted a lot of my social media recently and i would prefer to host my art here ^^


keep in mind that i cant remember when (and *if*) i ever finished a project :(
so, um, be kind to me! i am always happy to share how and why i do things, and you can contact me on my social meia below, or my [neocities profile!](https://neocities.org/site/internautica)
