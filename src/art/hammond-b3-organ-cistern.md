The days I don’t want to kill myself<br>
are extraordinary. Deep bass. All the people<br>
in the streets waiting for their high fives<br>
and leaping, I mean *leaping*,<br>
when they see me. I am the sun-filled<br>
god of love. Or at least an optimistic<br>
under-secretary. There should be a word for it.<br>
The days you wake up and do not want<br>
to slit your throat. Money in the bank.<br>
Enough for an iced green tea every weekday<br>
*and* Saturday and Sunday! It’s like being<br>
in the armpit of a Hammond B3 organ.<br>
Just reeks of gratitude and funk.<br>
The funk of ages. *I am not going to ruin<br>
my love’s life today.* It’s like the time I said yes<br>
to gray sneakers but then the salesman said<br>
Wait. And there, out of the back room,<br>
like the bakery’s first biscuits: bright-blue kicks.<br>
Iridescent. Like a scarab! Oh, who am I kidding,<br>
it was nothing like a scarab! It was like<br>
bright. blue. fucking. sneakers! I did not<br>
want to die that day. Oh, my God.<br>
Why don’t we talk about it? How good it feels.<br>
And if you don’t know then you’re lucky<br>
but also you poor thing. Bring the band out on the stoop.<br>
Let the whole neighborhood hear. Come on, Everybody.<br>
Say it with me nice and slow<br>
    *no pills   no cliff    no brains onthe floor*<br>
Bring the bass back.    *no rope  no hose*  not today, Satan.<br>
Every day I wake up with my good fortune<br>
and news of my demise. Don’t keep it from me.<br>
Why don’t we have a name for it?<br>
Bring the bass back. Bring the band out on the stoop.<br>
Hallelujah!
