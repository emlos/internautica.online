even though it's so very late 
and they have to report to their jobs
in a few hours, they both get in the car, 
one driving, one shotgun, you in the back 
like a child needing a drive to settle into sleep, 
even though one could drive and the other 
sleep, because they can't sleep 
without each other, they'd rather drive you 
across the city rather than be apart for half an hour, 
the office buildings lit pointlessly beautiful 
for nobody except you to admire their reflections 
in the water, the lovers too busy talking about that colleague they don't like, 
tomorrow's dinner plans, how once 
they bought peaches on a road trip and ate and ate 
until they could taste it in each other's pores, 
they get out of the car together to kiss you goodnight, 
you who have perfected the ghost goodbye, 
exiting gatherings noiselessly, leaving only 
a dahlia-scented perfume, your ribcage 
compressing to slide through doors ajar and untouched, 
yesterday you were a flash of white in a pigeon's blinking eye, 
in the day few hours old you stand solid and full
of other people's love for each other 
spilling over, warm leftovers.
