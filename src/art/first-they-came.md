First they came for the communists, and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a communist.<br>
First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a socialist.<br>
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a trade unionist.<br>
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—<br>
Because I was not a Jew.<br>
Then they came for me - and there was no one left to speak for me.<br>
