Felis Cattus, is your taxonomic nomenclature,<br>
an endothermic quadruped carnivorous by nature?<br>
Your visual, olfactory and auditory senses<br>
contribute to your hunting skills, and natural defenses.<br>

I find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations,<br>
a singular development of cat communications<br>
that obviates your basic hedonistic predilection<br>
for a rhythmic stroking of your fur, to demonstrate affection.<br>

A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents;<br>
you would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance.<br>
And when not being utilized to aide in locomotion,<br>
it often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion.<br>

O Spot, the complex levels of behaviour you display<br>
connote a fairly well-developed cognitive array.<br>
And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend,<br>
I nonetheless consider you a true and valued friend. <br>
