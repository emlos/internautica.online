Who doesn't toy with the thought of suicide sometimes? Or, like, most of the time? Okay, maybe some people don't â€“ like the happy scientist girl named Marie, or Jean-Marc, the superstar whom everyone loves. But you -- when the going gets rough, it's nice to think about your little trap door out of here. Do it. Put your finger on the eject button, see how alive it makes you feel -- the freedom of finality. Think of how much they'll *miss* you.
