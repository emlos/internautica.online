I am climbing a magnolia tree 
& you are telling me 
that magnolia trees existed 
before bees did which means that 
dinosaurs smelled magnolias 
& that maybe that
was the last scent
a dinosaur smelled
before it all went bad
& dark & bad &
when I am safely in the tree
you put your hands together 
in the shape of a bowl 
or a magnolia & that is
where I would like to sleep
& so I do & so I do.
