What if over tea, what if on our walks, what if
in the long yawn of the fog, what if in the long middle
of the wait, what if in the passage, in the what if
that carries us each day into seasons, what if 
in the renewed resilience, what if in the endlessness, 
what if in a lifetime of conversations,
what if in the clarity of consciousness, what if nothing changes?
