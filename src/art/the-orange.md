At lunchtime I bought a huge orange—<br>
The size of it made us all laugh.<br>
I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave—<br>
They got quarters and I had a half.<br>

And that orange, it made me so happy,<br>
As ordinary things often do<br>
Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.<br>
This is peace and contentment. It’s new.<br>

The rest of the day was quite easy.<br>
I did all the jobs on my list<br>
And enjoyed them and had some time over.<br>
I love you. I’m glad I exist.<br>
