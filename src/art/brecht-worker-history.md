Who built the seven gates of Thebes?<br>
The books are filled with names of kings.<br>
Was it the kings who hauled the craggy blocks of stone?<br>
And Babylon, so many times destroyed.<br>
Who built the city up each time? In which of Lima's houses,<br>
That city glittering with gold, lived those who built it?<br>
In the evening when the Chinese wall was finished<br>
Where did the masons go? Imperial Rome<br>
Is full of arcs of triumph. Who reared them up? Over whom<br>
Did the Caesars triumph? Byzantium lives in song.<br>
Were all her dwellings palaces? And even in Atlantis of the legend<br>
The night the seas rushed in,<br>
The drowning men still bellowed for their slaves.<br>
Young Alexander conquered India.<br>
He alone?<br>

Caesar beat the Gauls.<br>
Was there not even a cook in his army?<br>
Phillip of Spain wept as his fleet<br>
was sunk and destroyed. Were there no other tears?<br>
Frederick the Great triumphed in the Seven Years War.<br>
Who triumphed with him?<br>
Each page a victory<br>
At whose expense the victory ball?<br>
Every ten years a great man,<br>
Who paid the piper?<br>

So many particulars.<br>
So many questions.<br>
