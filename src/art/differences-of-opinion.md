He tells her that the earth is flatâ€”<br>
He knows the facts, and that is that.<br>
In altercations fierce and long<br>
She tries her best to prove him wrong.<br>
But he has learned to argue well.<br>
He calls her arguments unsound<br>
And often asks her not to yell.<br>
She cannot win. He stands his ground.<br>

The planet goes on being round.
