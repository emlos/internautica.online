And God, 
please let the deer 
on the highway 
get some kind of heaven. 
Something with tall soft grass 
and sweet reunion. 
Let the moths in porch lights 
go some place 
with a thousand suns, 
that taste like sugar 
and get swallowed whole. 
May the mice 
in oil and glue 
have forever dry, warm fur 
and full bellies.

If I am killed 
for simply living, 
let death be kinder 
than man.
