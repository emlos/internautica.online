I have always known that writing fiction had little effect on the  world; that if it did, young men would not have gone to war after The  Iliad. Only the privileged - those with homes and food and the luxury of time in a home - are touched, moved, sometimes changed by literature. For the twenty million Americans who are hungry tonight, for the homeless freezing tonight, literature is as useless as a knowledge of astronomy. What do stars look like on a clear cold winter night, when your children are hungry, are daily losing their very health; or when,  alone, you look up from a heat grate? Of course in cities at night you canâ€™t even see the stars.
