Alchemists,<br>
you were right, it is<br>
possible.<br>
We have the proof now.<br>
There are equations.<br>

If you could come back<br>
for a day, if you could<br>
conjure yourself into<br>
this chemistry classroom,<br>
if you could read the<br>
textbook or watch the<br>
professor writing the<br>
answers on the board…<br>

Alchemists,<br>
you would see that you<br>
were right, even though<br>
you didn’t know about<br>
alpha and beta radiation,<br>
even though you didn’t<br>
understand isotopes,<br>
you knew it was possible,<br>
that some elements can<br>
change into other elements,<br>
that transmutation can<br>
occur.<br>

Alchemists,<br>
there is proof now that<br>
it is possible, although<br>
each new element, having<br>
a brief half-life, would<br>
keep changing into other<br>
things.<br>

Alchemists,<br>
you were right, you can<br>
make anything, anything,<br>
uranium, plutonium, tel-<br>
lurium, mercury, copper,<br>
cobalt, platinum, silver,<br>
and gold, you can make<br>
gold, an isotope so<br>
radioactive it would<br>
sparkle before your eyes.<br>

Alchemists,<br>
you were right.<br>
It is magic.
