## SONG
[Verse 1]
Walking down the street all dressed in black
Like an undertaker in your top hat
Had a good education and all of that
And this is how you pay us back!

[Chorus]
You look like a vampire ready for the slaughter
Are you our child or Dracula's daughter?
You don't do nothing to respect our wishes

[Hayley Chopper]
You'll end up looking like the Scary Bitches

[Verse 2]
Long black dress made of satin and lace
Half a ton of make-up on your face
Big black boots, eyes like a cat
No son of mine's going out dressed like that!

[Chorus]
You look like a vampire ready for the slaughter
Are you our child or Dracula's daughter?
You don't do nothing to respect our wishes

[Hayley Chopper]
You'll end up looking like the Scary Bitches
[Verse 3]
Me and your father are going 'round the bend
We're sick with worry 'bout how it's gonna end
You'll be wandering 'round the countryside sleeping in ditches
Riding motorcycles and hanging out with witches
Your other mode of dress is even more bizarre
Gothing about like a cyber-tart
I don't know which is worse, the "Vampyre Trog"
Or the "transvestite robot from the planet Zog"

[Chorus]
You look like a vampire ready for the slaughter
Are you our child or Dracula's daughter?
You don't do nothing to respect our wishes

[Hayley Chopper]
You'll end up looking like the Scary Bitches
