6th century. a rival king killed her father, abducted her,
and and forced her into marriage, then forced her to
drink out of her father's decapitated skull. 
she had him assassinated.

Turn your back on me, dear husband
Just lie down in your room
I'm stepping out for just a moment
But I'll be back soon
Lay your sword down by your bedside-
How heavy it must be!
Pay no attention to the man in black
Who comes in quietly

No, you never once were good to me
Oh well! Oh well!
But tomorrow I'll be sleeping by myself
So well, so well

Are you sleeping well, dear husband?
Enjoy it while you can
I have waited for this moment
since the day you took my hand
My father's blood upon your face
Your soldiers all around
But I bet you didn't think
That I could put you in the ground

No, you never once were good to me
Oh well! Oh well!
But tomorrow I'll be sleeping by myself
So well, so well
Finally!

I am outside of the window
I am watching it unfold
And it's strange, but while you're sleeping
You don't look quite so old
Or quite so evil, quite so angry
Quite so twisted and perverse
But I carry all the memories
of our marriage like a curse
No, I will never wash away the taste
The wine you poured, your grinning face
My father's head shoved to my lips
Your hateful laugh, your icy grip

No you never once were good to me
Oh well! Oh well, oh well
But the sweet Italian night
Bids you farewell! Farewell! Farewell!
Finally!
## SONG
Rosamunda była córką lokalnego germańskiego króla w
VI wieku. Rywalizujący król zabił jej ojca, 
uprowadził ją i zmusił do małżeństwa, a następnie 
zmusił ją do picia z czaszki jej ojca. 
Ona zleciła jego zabójstwo.

Spij spokojnię drogi mężu
Po swojej stronie leż
Na sekunde tylko wyjdę
Za chwile wróce
Niech twój miecz spocznie przy łożu
To ciężkie brzemię jest
Nie przejmuj się meżczyzną w czerni
Co cicho wkrada się

ani razu dla mnie dobry nie byłeś
No nie! No nię!

But tomorrow I'll be sleeping by myself
So well, so well

Are you sleeping well, dear husband?
Enjoy it while you can
I have waited for this moment
since the day you took my hand
My father's blood upon your face
Your soldiers all around
But I bet you didn't think
That I could put you in the ground

No, you never once were good to me
Oh well! Oh well!
But tomorrow I'll be sleeping by myself
So well, so well
Finally!

I am outside of the window
I am watching it unfold
And it's strange, but while you're sleeping
You don't look quite so old
Or quite so evil, quite so angry
Quite so twisted and perverse
But I carry all the memories
of our marriage like a curse
No, I will never wash away the taste
The wine you poured, your grinning face
My father's head shoved to my lips
Your hateful laugh, your icy grip

No you never once were good to me
Oh well! Oh well, oh well
But the sweet Italian night
Bids you farewell! Farewell! Farewell!
Finally!
