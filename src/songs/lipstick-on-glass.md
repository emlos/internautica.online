## SONG
Otwieram drzwi, to jesteś ty
Przybiegłaś, widzę jeszcze drżysz
Gorące usta, gorące dłonie
W półmroku cała lśnisz

Powolnym ruchem sięgasz
I patrzysz poprzez szkło
Falujesz w rytmie zmierzchu
Przeciągasz się jak kot

Dotykam cię, a wtedy ty
Przymykasz czarne oczy
Budzisz się, znów cała lśnisz
Lśni się róża nocy

Odchodzisz, lecz zostawiasz
Na szklance szminki ślad
To nic, że ona przyjdzie
Zapyta jeszcze raz

Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick?
(Lipstick, lipstick)

Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick?
(Lipstick, lipstick)

Dotykam cię, a wtedy ty
Przymykasz czarne oczy
Budzisz się, znów cała lśnisz
Lśni się róża nocy

Odchodzisz, lecz zostawiasz
Na szklance szminki ślad
To nic, że ona przyjdzie
Zapyta jeszcze raz

Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick on the glass?

Otwieram drzwi, to znowu ty
Przybiegłaś, widzę jeszcze drżysz
Gorące usta, gorące dłonie
W półmroku cała lśnisz

Odchodzisz lecz zostawiasz
Na szklance szminki ślad
To nic, że ona przyjdzie
Zapyta jeszcze raz

Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick?
(Lipstick, lipstick)

Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick?
(Lipstick, lipstick)

Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick?
(Lipstick, lipstick)

Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick?

## SONG
Open the door, oh that's just you
You came to me, all shaken through
your eyes, your lips your hands white hot
youre shv'ring in the dusk

With a deliberate movement
You're looking through a shard
You're ripplig with the twillight
You're stretching like a cat

I'm touching you, you close your eyes
As if the night were sleeping
You're waking up, you shimmer dark
like a night rose is shimmering

You're leaving yet you left me
a lip print on the glass
You don't care that shes coming
And you'll know what she'll ask

Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick?
(Lipstick, lipstick)

Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick?
(Lipstick, lipstick)

I'm touching you, you close your eyes
As if the night were sleeping
You're waking up, you shimmer dark
like a night rose is shimmering

You're leaving yet you left me
a lip print on the glass
You know that she'll be coming
And you'll know what she'll ask

Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick on the glass?

Open the door, it's always you
You came to me, all shaken through
your eyes, your lips your eyes white hot
youre shiv'ring in the dusk

You're leaving yet you left me
a lip print on the glass
You know that she'll be coming
And you'll know what she'll ask

Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick?
(Lipstick, lipstick)

Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick?
(Lipstick, lipstick)

Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick?
(Lipstick, lipstick)

Whose that lipstick on the glass?
Whose that lipstick?
