## SONG
Just across from the hospital
Still inside in the red lights
A couple blocks from the Orthodox Church
That's where the old poet lived

In his eyeglasses and his necktie
And the window looking down
On the young man passing by
On the fullness of the town

Full of them good time gamblers
Full of their restless wives
Full of them midnight writers
Out in the quarter on a Friday night
Out in the brightness on a Friday night

And the big horns blowed and the pianos played
And the music rose to the old man's ears
I guess those were the olden days
I guess those were the golden years

And now the town is empty
Empty as a mirror
Empty as the harbor and the barber's chair
Where did the old poet go?
I asked around
Nobody knows

Maybe I came too early
Maybe I came too late
I'm waiting in the shadows of the scaffolds
Of the old cafés where you told me to wait

And I've got this lingering feeling
It's like I've slipped in between
Fingers of the century
I know you know what I mean

I'll be a good time gambler
I'll be a restless wife
I'll be a midnight writer
Out in the quarter on a Friday night

Call me a good-time gambler
Call me a restless wife
Call me a midnight writer

Out in the quarter on a Friday night
Out in the brightness of a Friday night
Call me the brightness of a Friday night
## SONG



Tam mieszkał ten poeta

W okularach, w muszce, przy oknie stał
oglądajać, ludzi szał



Pełno pewnych moglarzy
pełno niepewnych żon
pełno nocnych pisarzy
kiedy dwunasta wybija dzwon
kiedy jest jasno w piątkową noc






A teraz w mieście pusto
puste odbicie
pusto u fryzjera i port pusty jest
gdzie poeta podział się?
chodź pytam to
Nikt nic nie wie-e

Może jestem za wcześnie
Może spóźniłam się
Bo czekam sama w cieniu szafot
w kawiarenkach czekając na ciebie
