### programming is fun! \*clenches fist\* :)

not much happening, but its an update, yeah? never said those would be consistent

- last year [i went to paris](/posts/i-went-to-paris). i wrote about it. its unnecessarily dramatic, and painfully personal, not to mention i never wrote anything like that... not since school haha
- completely rehauled the eleventy side of the minigame code. its practically completely modular now, so thats fun
- me and a friend have been talking about possible new characters (audrey and para anyone?) and outfits, but im in heidelberg now so no drawing is gonna be happening
- im working on an arch linux install tutorial, for shits and giggles

on a personal note, ive been struggling more and more recently, because of my appearance. also im making my hair green again, its a long process

stay alive out there -milo
