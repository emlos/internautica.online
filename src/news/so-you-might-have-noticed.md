### new things?

not many!
but as you mightve seen, the last (undocumented) "*big*" site update was done to rework some css and make it a *bit* more responsive. that plus the art page has been completely rehauled (check it out [here]({{'/art/' | url}}) if you havent already!). its where i put things that i find ~evocative~ for whatever reason, and there's also tags and their dedicated pages ^^

on a sidenote eleventy devs: PLEASE add a dedicated neste pagination support, that allows you to add pagination INSIDE the paginated tag pages from collections.all!!! [there *is* a plugin for it on [here](https://github.com/sielay/eleventy-plugin-blog/blob/master/README.md) but its fucky and like 5 versions outdated so.... please make this builtin because if i have to write a javascript collection for EVERY tag i'll go insane ahah] 
aside over LMAO

back to things that are new! i am going to a psychologist for the fist time in  10 months!!!! <= personal update quota reached :]

do you have hobbies? i do! i *really*, no, **really** enjoy translating songs (though im sure theres a word for that that's better than simple *translation*. transliteration maybe?) 
it's a bit like pulling teeth, but i did manage to force my brain to finish some songs, you can check out the labors of my love [here]({{'/translation/' | url}})

and hey - on the off-chance you want a song translated to/from **german** **english** or **polish** shoot me a message on my profile! i'm *usually* up for a challenge, though there *are* songs that are simply.... untranslateable :/

beyond that... i went to paris, i bought a dirndl, i keep existing, like a cockroach behind the fridge of the universe

so thats all for this one, hope yall enjoy!
