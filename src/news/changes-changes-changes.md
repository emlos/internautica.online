### keeping it simple
changes:
- a lot of internal eleventy stuff that you can check out in my (repository)[https://github.com/emlos/internautica.online] on github
- adjusted a bit of css and removed some graphics + added some of mine
- each tag on the art page has its' own page too now!
- some things that are not yet visible but trust me i am trying to work on things....

the shrines remain placeholded, since i have been going through things, but i have to keep fighting the urge to ad css so... maybe its time now?

anyway, im trying to write something... something useful that is, but it turns out i have nothing to say :(
well, till next time!
