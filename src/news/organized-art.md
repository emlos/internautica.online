### featuring: cool art gallery!

i figured out (halfway anyway) how pagination an collections work! :D
so here, check out my new page [here!]({{url}}/art/)!

still no css, that's a bit further down the pipeline, since before i start fiddling with sass (yeah i *am* leaning sass, no its not going well) i want to have the base structure and ~~all~~ most of the features from the previous version!

also in this update i bring you /robots.txt, /sitemap.xml (with a robots.txt), a 404 page and an improved news page! 

im not sure if i'll keep these update notes, but for now i cant be arsed to squash and organize my repo commits haha. for the features coming up next: regina spektor fanpage! and (possibly) other [planned] placeholder pags :D
