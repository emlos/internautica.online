### officially internautica.online now!

yeah i finally decided to shill out the 5 bucks for neo supporter and 20 eur per year for a domain name because its fun yanno? plus apparently i could upload any filetype i want now, though i havent tested it :o

the changes are as follows:

- news based on my github commits are displayed on the main screen, which hopefully will encourage me to be more normal and descriptive
- some accessibility features: dark/light mode, dyslexic freindly font, animation stop button and refactoring of several html components to be more specific than divs!
- the site should be fully responsive now, so mobile readers can peruse the admittedly meager content
- new pages: [art that ive done](/mine), and a landing page that gives some info about the site, with a cookie disclaimer
- theres been some backend changes, cause i need things to be super duper modular and efficient, which makes writing code for backend take 70% longer than doing it quick and dirty and expanding it later lmao
- some new images for the footer and a new favicon :333
- were officially internautica.online!!!! super excited about this hehe
- im adding new [art i like](/art) whenever the mood/spoons strike me [bro that css was so annoying why do i do that to myself]

neos uploading system is still verry *annoyingly* limited, so i have to reupload every file in my paginated subpages because of hashes or ordering or something grrr i should look into mounting as a drive, but its 4 am so im going zzzzz mimimimi

about my personal life updates, i continue to exist with more or less sever mood swings, though ive taken up smoking instead of drinking, and im currently dealing with a fruitflies infestation :(
oh and i dyed my hair red again, but a more cherry color this time :D

and for last, if the images on the art-i-like page looked... well like shit it was my bad, i uploaded the dev version by mistake :||| sorry bout that lol!

well thats all, till next time internauts!
