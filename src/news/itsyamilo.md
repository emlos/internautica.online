well. um. hiiii

im moving out in two weeks, artfight is in two days, work has been ... *good*
i made a first friend i like since... forever, i got almost evicted for having my apartment be a fucking shithouse, my twitter acc got suspended for hating on taylor alison swift, i went to rock im park and pyrkon, and i have a plan for the next 3 years

so for me it was a quite a full few months i guess

onto the new things:
- the big secret thing i started in february? um... ahahhaa well-
- the [song](/translation) page is getting better and better, as does [my art "gallery"](/mine)
- hmm what else... do the dress down mingames work? no <3
- but i *did* rebase this whole fucking repository and fuck me, there are no protections on this thing? like anyone can push ahahaha well. im not changing that lmao
- artfights around the corner so im gonna upload more drawings, and check out the [found art](/art) from time to time, i sometimes update it :)
- 
to another year of not killing yourself (they say in june) - milo
