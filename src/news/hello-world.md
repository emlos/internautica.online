### hey, welcome to the new and revamped..... internautica 2!!!

i mean im keeping the name and stuff, but im trying to make this whole website thing... the right way

so im using [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev)!

instead of copy and pasting common elements like navigation, headers, footers etc... it uses templates to fill my website, and generates a whole static website for me! i just have to update it myself, but it's like a very slow manual me-powered server haha

i would like to keep this separated into a more technical and a media/oc/fandom part, and id like to make some technical guides lmao
